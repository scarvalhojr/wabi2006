\begin{abstract}
The production of commercial DNA microarrays is based on a
light-directed chemical synthesis driven by a set of masks or
micromirror arrays. Because of the natural properties of light and the
ever shrinking feature sizes, the arrangement of the probes on the
chip and the order in which their nucleotides are synthesized play an
important role on the quality of the final product. We propose a new
model called \emph{conflict index} for evaluating microarray layouts.

\section{Introduction}
% ==============================================================================

An oligonucleotide microarray is a piece of glass or plastic on which
single-stranded fragments of DNA, called \emph{probes}, are affixed or
synthesized. The chips produced by Affymetrix, for instance, can contain
more than one million spots (or \emph{features}) as small as 11 $\mu$m,
with each spot accommodating several million copies of a probe. Probes
are typically 25 nucleotides long and are synthesized in parallel, on
the chip, in a series of repetitive steps. Each step appends the same
nucleotide to probes of selected regions of the chip. Selection occurs
by exposure to light with the help of a photolithographic mask that
allows or obstructs the passage of light accordingly \cite{FODOR91}.

Formally, we have a set of probes $\mathcal{P} = \{p_{1}, p_{2}, ... p_{n}\}$
that are produced by a series of masks $\mathcal{M} = (m_{1}, m_{2}, ... m_{\mu})$,
where each mask $m_{k}$ induces the addition of a particular nucleotide
$t_{k} \in \{A, C, G, T\}$ to a subset of~$\mathcal{P}$. The \emph{nucleotide
deposition sequence} $\mathcal{S} = t_{1} t_{2} \ldots t_{\mu}$ corresponding
to the sequence of nucleotides added at each masking step is therefore a
supersequence of all $p_{i} \in \mathcal{P}$ \cite{RAHMANN03}.

In general, a probe can be \emph{embedded} within $\mathcal{S}$ in several
ways. An embedding of $p_{i}$ is a $\mu$-tuple
$\varepsilon_{i} = (e_{i,1}, e_{i,2}, ... e_{i,\mu})$ in which $e_{i,k} = 1$
if probe $p_{i}$ receives nucleotide $t_{k}$ (at step~$k$), or 0 otherwise
(Figure~\ref{fig:masking_process}).

\label{fig:masking_process}
\end{figure}

Deposition sequences are usually cyclical, that is $\mathcal{S}$ is a repeated
permutation of the alphabet. This is mainly because such sequences maximize the
number of possible subsequences \cite{CHASE76}. In this context, we can
distinguish between \emph{synchronous} and \emph{asynchronous} embeddings. In
the first case, each probe has one and only one nucleotide synthesized in every
cycle of the deposition sequence; hence, 100 masking steps are needed to
synchronously synthesize probes of length 25. In the case of asynchronous
embeddings, probes can have any number of nucleotides synthesized in any given
cycle. This allows for shorter deposition sequences. All Affymetrix chips that
we know of can be asynchronously synthesized in 74 masking steps\footnote{We
understand that Affymetrix uses the same truncated repetition of TGCA to
synthesize all of their chips, which suggests that their probe selection only
chooses probes that fit into that deposition sequence.}.

Because of diffraction of light or internal reflection, untargeted spots can
sometimes be accidentally activated in a certain masking step, producing
unpredicted probes that can compromise the results of an experiment. This issue
was described by \cite{FODOR91}, who noted that the problem is more likely to
occur near the borders between masked and unmasked spots. This observation has
given rise to the term \emph{border conflict}.

We are interested in finding an arrangement of the probes on the chip together
with their embeddings in such a way that we minimize the chances of unintended
illumination during mask exposure steps. This problem appears to be hard
(although the authors are not aware of an NP-hardness proof, and our QAP
formulation has several special properties) because of the exponential number
of possible arrangements, and optimal solutions are unlikely to be found even
for very small chips and even if we consider the probes as having a single
pre-defined embedding.

If we consider all valid embeddings, the problem is even harder. A typical probe
of an Affymetrix chip, for instance, can have up to several million possible
embeddings. For this reason, the problem has been traditionally tackled in two
phases. First, an initial embedding of the probes is fixed and an arrangement of
these embeddings on the chip with minimum border conflicts is sought. This is
usually referred to as the \emph{placement} problem. Second, a \emph{post-placement}
optimization phase re-embeds the probes considering its location on the chip,
in such a way that the conflicts with the neighboring spots are further reduced.

In the next section, we review the Border Length Minimization Problem
\cite{HANNENHALLI02}, and define an extended model for evaluating microarray
layouts. In Section~\ref{sec:previous_work}, we briefly review existing
placement strategies.

\section{Modeling}
% ==============================================================================
\label{sec:model}

\subsection{Border Length}

\cite{HANNENHALLI02} were the first to give a formal definition to the problem
of unintended illumination in the production of microarrays. They formulated the
\emph{Border Length Minimization Problem}, which aims at finding an arrangement
of the probes together with their embeddings in such a way the number of border
conflicts during mask exposure steps is minimal.

The \emph{border length}~$\mathcal{B}_k$ of a mask~$m_{k}$ is simply
defined as the number of borders shared by masked and unmasked spots
at masking step~$k$. The total border length of a given arrangement is
the sum of border lengths over all masks. For example, in
Figure~\ref{fig:masking_process}, the four masks shown have
$\mathcal{B}_1 = 4$, $\mathcal{B}_2 = 6$, $\mathcal{B}_3 = 6$ and $\mathcal{B}_4 = 4$.
The total border length of that arrangement is 50.

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Conflict Index}

The border length of an individual mask measures the quality of that
mask. We are more interested in estimating the risk of synthesizing a faulty
probe at a given spot. That is, we need a per-spot measure
instead of a per-mask measure. Additionally, \cite{KAHNG03A} noted
that the definition of border length does not take into account two
simple yet important practical considerations:
\begin{itemize}
\item[a)] stray light might activate not only adjacent neighbors but
  also probes that lie as far as three cells away from the targeted
  spot;
\item[b)] imperfections produced in the middle of a probe are more
  harmful than in its extremities.
\end{itemize}
This motivates the following definition of the \emph{conflict
  index}~$\mathcal{C}(s)$ of a spot~$s$ whose probe of
length~$\ell_{s}$ is synthesized in $\mu$~masking steps. First we
define a distance-dependent weighting function, $\delta(s,s',k)$, that
accounts for observation a) above:
%%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:dist_weight}
\delta(s,s',k) :=
        \left\{
                \begin{array}{ll}
                        (d(s,s'))^{-2} & \mbox{if $s'$ is unmasked at step $k$}, \\
                        0 & \mbox{otherwise}, \\
                \end{array}
        \right.
\end{equation}
%%
where $d(s,s')$ is the Euclidian distance between spots~$s$ and~$s'$.
This form of weighting function is the same as suggested in
\cite{KAHNG03A}.  Note that $\delta$ is a ``closeness'' measure
between $s$ and $s'$ only if the spot in the neighboring spot $s'$ is
not masked (and thus creates the potential of illumination at $s$). To
restrict the number of neighbors that need to be considered, we
restrict the support of $\delta(s,s',\cdot)$ to those $s'\neq s$ that
are in a $7\times 7$ grid centered around $s$ (see
Figure~\ref{fig:conflictindex}~top).


We use position-dependent weights to account for observation b):
%%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:pos_mult}
\omega(s,k) :=
        \left\{
                \begin{array}{ll}
                        c \cdot \exp{\left(\theta \cdot \lambda(s,k)\right)} & \mbox{if $s$ is masked at step $k$}, \\
                        0 & \mbox{otherwise}, \\
                \end{array}
        \right.
\end{equation}
%%
where $c>0$ and $\theta>0$ are constants, and
%%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:base_pos}
  \lambda(s,k) := 1 + \min(b_{s,k},\ell_{s} - b_{s,k})
\end{equation}
%%
is the distance of the nucleotide synthesized in step $k$ (if any)
from the start or end of the probe: $b_{s,k}$ denotes the number of
nucleotides synthesized at spot~$s$ up to and including step~$k$ and
$\ell_s$ is the probe length (see Figure~\ref{fig:conflictindex}
bottom). We set the constants $c$ and $\theta$ as follows:
\[ \theta = \frac{5}{\ell_s}; \qquad c = \frac{1}{\exp{\theta}}. \]
It is generally agreed that the chances of a successful hybridization
between probe and target are higher if a mismatched base occurs at the
extremities of the formed duplex instead of at its center. The precise
effects of this position, however, is not yet fully understood and has
been an active topic of research \cite{BINDER05}. The motivation
behind an exponentially increasing weighting function is that the
probability of a successful stable hybridization of a probe with its
target should increase exponentially with the absolute value of its
Gibbs free energy, which increases linearly with the length of the
longest perfect match between probe and target. The parameter $\theta$
controls how steeply the exponential weighting function rises towards
the middle of the probe.

We now define the conflict index of a spot $s$ as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:conf_idx}
\mathcal{C}(s) := \sum_{k=1}^{\mu} \left( \omega(s,k) \sum_{s'} \delta(s,s',k) \right),
\end{equation}
%%
where $s'$ ranges over all spots that are at most three cells away
from $s$.  $\mathcal{C}(s)$ can be interpreted as the fraction of
faulty probes (because of unwanted illumination) produced at spot $s$.

\label{fig:conflictindex}
\end{figure}

Finally, we note the following relation between conflict indices and border
lengths: Define $\delta(s,s',k):=1$ if $s'$ is a direct neighbor of $s$ and is
unmasked in step $k$, and $:=0$ otherwise.  Also define $\omega(s,k):=1$ if
$s$ is masked in step $k$, and $:=0$ otherwise. Then $\sum_s\, \mathcal{C}(s)
= 2 \sum_{k=1}^\mu\, \mathcal{B}_k$, as each border conflict is counted twice:
for $s'$ and $s$.

This shows that total border length and total conflict are correlated: A good
layout is one with low border length as well as low average conflict index,
although it is clearly possible to observe a reduction of the conflict index
at the expense of an increase in border length, and vice-versa.

\section{Previous Work}
% ==============================================================================
\label{sec:previous_work}

We briefly review existing layout techniques, distinguishing between placement
algorithms and partitioning algorithms. Post-placement optimizations such as the
Chessboard \cite{KAHNG02} are not covered.

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Placement Algorithms}
\label{sec:placement_alg}

\ignore{The first to formally address the border length problem were \cite{FELDMAN93}.
They showed how an optimal placement can be constructed based on a two-dimensional
Gray code. However, their work is restricted to \emph{uniform arrays} (arrays
containing all possible probes of a given length) and synchronous embeddings.}

\cite{HANNENHALLI02} were the first to consider the border length problem on large
oligonucleotide arrays of arbitrary probes. They reported that the first Affymetrix
chips were designed using a heuristic for the traveling salesman problem (TSP). The
idea consists of building a weighted graph with nodes representing probes and edges
containing the Hamming distance between the probes. A TSP tour is approximated,
resulting in consecutive probes in the tour being likely to be similar. The TSP
tour is finally \emph{threaded} on the array in a row-by-row fashion.
\cite{HANNENHALLI02} suggested a different threading of the TSP tour on the chip,
called \emph{1-threading}, to achieve up to 20\% reduction in border length.

\cite{KAHNG02} propose the \emph{epitaxial placement algorithm} that
places a random probe in the center of the array and continues to
insert probes in spots adjacent to already filled spots, employing a
greedy heuristic to select the next spot to be filled and the probe
that is assigned to it. Priority is given to spots whose
neighbors are already filled, in which case the algorithm places the
probe with minimum sum of Hamming distances to its neighbors. If no
such a spot exists, the algorithm examines all non-filled spots~$s_i$
with $n_i \geq 1$ filled neighbors and finds a non-assigned probe
$p_j$ with minimum sum of Hamming distances to the neighboring probes
$H_{ij}$. For each possible assignment of $p_j$ to $s_i$, it computes
a cost $c(s_i,p_j) := k_{n_i} H_{ij} / n$, where $k_{n_i}$ are scaling
coefficients ($k_1 = 1$, $k_2 = 0.8$, and $k_3 = 0.6$), and makes the
assignment with minimum cost. With this algorithm, they claimed to
achieve up to 10\% reduction in border conflicts over the TSP-based
approach of \cite{HANNENHALLI02}.

\ignore{
The major problem with the epitaxial and the TSP-based algorithm is that they have at least quadratic time complexity and thus are not scalable for the latest million-probe microarrays. According to their experiments, the TSP approach needed around 32 minutes to produce the layout of a 200\,x\,200 chip, whereas the epitaxial algorithm needed 74 minutes on average. For a 500\,x\,500 chip, the TSP took over 30 hours to complete, whereas the epitaxial algorithm did not complete ``due to prohibitively large running time or memory requirements'' \cite{KAHNG02}.
}

\ignore{This observation has led to the development of two new algorithms by \cite{KAHNG03A}. The first one, called sliding-window matching (SWM), is not exactly a placement algorithm as it iteratively improves an initial placement that can be constructed by, for instance, TSP and 1-threading. Improvements are achieved by selecting an independent set of spots inside the window and optimally replacing their probes using a minimum-weight perfect matching algorithm. The term independent refers to probes that can be replaced without affecting the border length of the other selected probes.}

Both the TSP and the epitaxial approach do not scale well to large
chips.  Another algorithm described by \cite{KAHNG03A} is a variant
of the epitaxial algorithm, called \emph{row-epitaxial}, with two main
differences: spots are filled in a pre-defined order, namely
row-by-row, and only probes of a limited list of candidates $Q$ are
considered when filling each spot. Their experimental results showed
that the row-epitaxial is the best large-scale placement algorithm,
achieving up to 9\% reduction in border length when compared to the
TSP-based approach of \cite{HANNENHALLI02}.

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Partitioning Algorithms}
\label{sec:partition}

The ever growing number of probes on the latest microarrays and the properties of
the placement problem naturally suggest the use of partitioning strategies to reduce
the running time of the algorithms. The placement problem can be partitioned by
dividing the set of probes into smaller sub-sets, and assigning these sub-sets to
sub-regions of the chip. Each sub-region can then be treated as an independent chip
or recursively partitioned. These smaller sub-problems, when solved, immediately
constitute a final solution. In this way, algorithms with non-linear time or space
complexities can be used compute the layout of larger chips that otherwise would not
be feasible. A partitioning is clearly a compromise in solution quality. However,
due to the large number of probes, this compromise can be small, specially if the
partitioning is able to place similar probes together.

The only partitioning algorithm available in the literature is the centroid-based
quadrisection \cite{KAHNG03B}. It is a recursive procedure that works as follows.
First, it randomly selects a probe $c_1$ from the probe set $\mathcal{P}$. Then,
it examines all other probes of $\mathcal{P}$ and selects $c_2$ with maximum
$h(c_1,c_2)$, where $h(c_1,c_2)$ is the Hamming distance between the embeddings
of $c_1$ and $c_2$. Similarly it finds $c_3$ with maximum $h(c_1,c_3) + h(c_2,c_3)$
and $c_4$ with maximum $h(c_1,c_4) + h(c_2,c_4) + h(c_3,c_4)$. Probes
$c_1$, $c_2$, $c_3$ and $c_4$ are called centroids. All other probes
$p_i \in \mathcal{P}$ are then compared to the centroids and assigned to the sub-set
$\mathcal{P}_j$ associated with $c_j$ with minimum $h(p_i,c_j)$. Each sub-set
$\mathcal{P}_j$ is assigned to a sub-region of the chip. The procedure is repeated
recursively on each sub-region until a given recursion depth is reached.

The result of this algorithm is a partitioning of the chip into several sub-regions
and an assignment of sub-sets of $\mathcal{P}$ to each sub-region. For the actual
placement of the probes in each sub-region, another algorithm is needed. For this
purpose, \cite{KAHNG03B} have used the row-epitaxial algorithm. 

\ignore{Their results show that the running time of the row-epitaxial algorithm
drops significantly with increasing recursion depth. The time required to place
the probes of a 500\,x\,500 chip, for instance, dropped by 69\% with $L = 3$ when
compared with the time required by the row-epitaxial without any partitioning.

It is not clear from their experiments, however, how the choice of $L$ impaired
the performance of the row-epitaxial algorithm in terms of solution quality since
they have restricted their experiments to $L \leq 3$. Moreover, there is no clear
trend toward reduction or increase in border length as $L$ varies from~0 to~3.}
